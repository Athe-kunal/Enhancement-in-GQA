## TO-DOS

1. Write the data parallel code for all the benchmark scripts
2. T5WGQA code fix and do the experiment and compare with simple mean heuristic (later we can do with other types of aggregations mean, max, first, random)
3. T5SGQA epoch based similarity (later if time permits with all these experiments)
4. MAX LENGTH parameter
